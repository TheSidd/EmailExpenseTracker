# Track your Expenses from bank email alerts

**Update**: Added excel to track Axis Magnus latest T&C 

**TLDR –**
* Periodically all credit card transactions are automatically fetched from your email
* Transactions are added to google sheet
* Expected default rewards generated and milestones achievement calculated
* The emails processed are labeled so that there no duplicate transactions

**Drawbacks** –
* Refunds cannot be calculated as no email
* If email template is changed by the bank, need to modify script

**Security & Privacy** –
* Main reason to create this and not rely on third-party apps
* Everything remains private in your account
